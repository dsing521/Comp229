                  My name is Damandeep Singh. I'm a Software Engineering technology - Artificial Intelligence student at Centennial College. I was born and raised in Punjab, India. <br>
                  I did senior schooling from Innocent hearts school, Jalandhar, Punjab, India.  <br>
                  I like to travel and listen Music. I believe travelling gives you a new perspective to everything. You get to know a lot about the different cultures, the cuisines, their history, the language and all the small unique things every place has to offer.
                  Similarly, music helps in refreshing our minds and motivate us to the things that we wanted to do. Musics also helps in the expansion of our thoughts.
